## Introduction

- It causes chaos to disrupt state of GCP persistent disk volume by detaching it from its VM instance for a certain chaos duration using the disk name.

## Uses

    coming soon

## Prerequisites

??? info "Verify the prerequisites" 
    - Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.16 
    -  Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing <code>kubectl get pods</code> in operator namespace (typically, <code>litmus</code>).If not, install from <a href="https://v1-docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus">here</a>
    -  Ensure that the <code>gcp-vm-disk-loss</code> experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing <code>kubectl get chaosexperiments</code> in the desired namespace. If not, install from <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/gcp/gcp-vm-disk-loss/experiment.yaml">here</a>
    - Ensure that your service account has an editor access or owner access for the GCP project.
    - Ensure that the target disk volume is not a boot disk of any VM instance.
    - Ensure to create a Kubernetes secret having the GCP service account credentials in the default namespace. A sample secret file looks like:

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
          name: cloud-secret
        type: Opaque
        stringData:
          type: 
          project_id: 
          private_key_id: 
          private_key: 
          client_email: 
          client_id: 
          auth_uri: 
          token_uri: 
          auth_provider_x509_cert_url: 
          client_x509_cert_url: 
        ``` 
    
## Default Validations

??? info "View the default validations" 
    - Disk volumes are attached to their respective instances

## Minimal RBAC configuration example (optional)

!!! tip "NOTE"   
    If you are using this experiment as part of a litmus workflow scheduled constructed & executed from chaos-center, then you may be making use of the [litmus-admin](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-admin-rbac.yaml) RBAC, which is pre installed in the cluster as part of the agent setup.

## Experiment Examples

### Common Experiment Tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common-tunables-for-all-experiments.md) to tune the common tunables for all the experiments.

### Detach Volumes By Names

It contains comma separated list of volume names subjected to disk loss chaos. It will detach all the disks with the given `DISK_VOLUME_NAMES` disk names and corresponding `ZONES` zone names and the `DEVICE_NAMES` device names in `GCP_PROJECT_ID` project.  It reattached the volume after waiting for the specified `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` duration.

`NOTE:` The `DISK_VOLUME_NAMES` contains multiple comma-separated disk names. The comma-separated zone names should be provided in the same order as disk names.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/gcp/gcp-vm-disk-loss/gcp-disk-loss.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## details of the gcp disk
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: gcp-vm-disk-loss-sa
  experiments:
  - name: gcp-vm-disk-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # comma separated list of disk volume names
        - name: DISK_VOLUME_NAMES
          value: 'disk-01,disk-02'
        # comma separated list of zone names corresponds to the DISK_VOLUME_NAMES
        # it should be provided in same order of DISK_VOLUME_NAMES
        - name: ZONES
          value: 'zone-01,zone-02'
        # comma separated list of device names corresponds to the DISK_VOLUME_NAMES
        # it should be provided in same order of DISK_VOLUME_NAMES
        - name: DEVICE_NAMES
          value: 'device-01,device-02'
        # gcp project id to which disk volume belongs
        - name: GCP_PROJECT_ID
          value: 'project-id'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Mutiple Iterations Of Chaos

The multiple iterations of chaos can be tuned via setting `CHAOS_INTERVAL` ENV. Which defines the delay between each iteration of chaos.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/gcp/gcp-vm-disk-loss/chaos-interval.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# defines delay between each successive iteration of the chaos
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: gcp-vm-disk-loss-sa
  experiments:
  - name: gcp-vm-disk-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # delay between each iteration of chaos
        - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
          value: '15'
        # time duration for the chaos execution
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
        - name: DISK_VOLUME_NAMES
          value: 'disk-01,disk-02'
        - name: ZONES
          value: 'zone-01,zone-02'
        - name: DEVICE_NAMES
          value: 'device-01,device-02'
        - name: GCP_PROJECT_ID
          value: 'project-id'
        
```
