## Introduction

- It causes termination of an EC2 instance by instance ID or list of instance IDs before bringing it back to running state after the specified chaos duration.
- It helps to check the performance of the application/process running on the ec2 instance.
When the MANAGED_NODEGROUP is enable then the experiment will not try to start the instance post chaos instead it will check of the addition of the new node instance to the cluster.

## Uses

    coming soon

## Prerequisites

??? info "Verify the prerequisites" 
    - Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.16 
    -  Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing <code>kubectl get pods</code> in operator namespace (typically, <code>litmus</code>).If not, install from <a href="https://v1-docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus">here</a>
    -  Ensure that the <code>ec2-terminate-by-id</code> experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing <code>kubectl get chaosexperiments</code> in the desired namespace. If not, install from <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/kube-aws/ec2-terminate-by-id/experiment.yaml">here</a>
    - Ensure that you have sufficient AWS access to stop and start an ec2 instance. 
    - Ensure to create a Kubernetes secret having the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. A sample secret file looks like:

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
          name: cloud-secret
        type: Opaque
        stringData:
          cloud_config.yml: |-
            # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
            [default]
            aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
            aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        ```
    - If you change the secret key name (from `cloud_config.yml`) please also update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` 
    ENV value on `experiment.yaml`with the same name.

    ### WARNING

    If the target EC2 instance is a part of a self-managed nodegroup:
    Make sure to drain the target node if any application is running on it and also ensure to cordon the target node before running the experiment so that the experiment pods do not schedule on it. 
    
## Default Validations

??? info "View the default validations" 
    - EC2 instance should be in healthy state.

## Minimal RBAC configuration example (optional)

!!! tip "NOTE"   
    If you are using this experiment as part of a litmus workflow scheduled constructed & executed from chaos-center, then you may be making use of the [litmus-admin](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-admin-rbac.yaml) RBAC, which is pre installed in the cluster as part of the agent setup.

## Experiment Examples

### Common and AWS specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common-tunables-for-all-experiments.md) and [AWS specific tunable](AWS-experiments-tunables.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and aws specific tunables.  

### Stop Instances By ID

It contains comma separated list of instances IDs subjected to ec2 stop chaos. It can be tuned via `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/aws/ec2-terminate-by-id/instance-id.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# contains the instance id, to be terminated/stopped
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: ec2-terminate-by-id-sa
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-terminate-by-id
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # id of the ec2 instance
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        # region for the ec2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: '<region for EC2_INSTANCE_ID>'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
