## Introduction

- It taints the node to apply the desired effect. The resources which contains the correspoing tolerations can only bypass the taints.

## Uses

??? info "View the uses of the experiment" 
    coming soon

## Prerequisites

??? info "Verify the prerequisites" 
    - Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.16 
    - Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing <code>kubectl get pods</code> in operator namespace (typically, <code>litmus</code>).If not, install from <a href="https://v1-docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus">here</a>
    - Ensure that the <code>node-taint</code> experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing <code>kubectl get chaosexperiments</code> in the desired namespace. If not, install from <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/generic/node-taint/experiment.yaml">here</a>
    - Ensure that the node specified in the experiment ENV variable <code>TARGET_NODE</code> (the node which will be tainted) should be cordoned before execution of the chaos experiment (before applying the chaosengine manifest) to ensure that the litmus experiment runner pods are not scheduled on it / subjected to eviction. This can be achieved with the following steps:
        - Get node names against the applications pods: <code>kubectl get pods -o wide</code>
        - Cordon the node <code>kubectl cordon &lt;nodename&gt;</code>
    
## Default Validations

??? info "View the default validations" 
    The target nodes should be in ready state before and after chaos injection.

## Minimal RBAC configuration example (optional)

!!! tip "NOTE"   
    If you are using this experiment as part of a litmus workflow scheduled constructed & executed from chaos-center, then you may be making use of the [litmus-admin](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-admin-rbac.yaml) RBAC, which is pre installed in the cluster as part of the agent setup.

## Experiment Examples

### Common and Node specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common-tunables-for-all-experiments.md) and [Node specific tunable](common-tunables-for-node-experiments.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and node specific tunables.  

### Taint Label

It contains label and effect to be tainted on application node. It can be tuned via `TAINT_LABEL` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/nodes/node-taint/taint-labels.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# node tainted with provided key and effect
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: node-taint-sa
  experiments:
  - name: node-taint
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # label and effect to be tainted on the targeted node
        - name: TAINT_LABEL
          value: 'key=value:effect'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
