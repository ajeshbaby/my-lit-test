## Introduction

- This experiment Causes the application to become unreachable on account of node turning unschedulable (NotReady) due to docker service kill
- The docker service has been stopped/killed on a node to make it unschedulable for a certain duration i.e TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION. The application node should be healthy after the chaos injection and the services should be reaccessable.
- The application implies services. Can be reframed as: Test application resiliency upon replica getting unreachable caused due to docker service down.

## Uses

    coming soon

## Prerequisites

??? info "Verify the prerequisites" 
    - Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.16 
    - Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing <code>kubectl get pods</code> in operator namespace (typically, <code>litmus</code>).If not, install from <a href="https://v1-docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus">here</a>
    - Ensure that the <code>docker-service-kill</code> experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing <code>kubectl get chaosexperiments</code> in the desired namespace. If not, install from <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/generic/docker-service-kill/experiment.yaml">here</a>
    - Ensure that the node specified in the experiment ENV variable <code>TARGET_NODE</code> (the node for which docker service need to be killed) should be cordoned before execution of the chaos experiment (before applying the chaosengine manifest) to ensure that the litmus experiment runner pods are not scheduled on it / subjected to eviction. This can be achieved with the following steps:
        - Get node names against the applications pods: <code>kubectl get pods -o wide</code>
        - Cordon the node <code>kubectl cordon &lt;nodename&gt;</code>
    
## Default Validations

??? info "View the default validations" 
    The target nodes should be in ready state before and after chaos injection.

## Minimal RBAC configuration example (optional)

!!! tip "NOTE"   
    If you are using this experiment as part of a litmus workflow scheduled constructed & executed from chaos-center, then you may be making use of the [litmus-admin](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-admin-rbac.yaml) RBAC, which is pre installed in the cluster as part of the agent setup.

## Experiment Examples

### Common and Node specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common-tunables-for-all-experiments.md) and [Node specific tunable](common-tunables-for-node-experiments.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and node specific tunables.  

### Kill Docker Service

It contains name of target node subjected to the chaos. It can be tuned via `TARGET_NODE` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/nodes/docker-service-kill/docker-service-kill.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# kill the docker service of the target node
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: docker-service-kill-sa
  experiments:
  - name: docker-service-kill
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # name of the target node
        - name: TARGET_NODE
          value: 'node01'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
