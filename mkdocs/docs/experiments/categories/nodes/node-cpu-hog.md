## Introduction

- This experiment causes CPU resource exhaustion on the Kubernetes node. The experiment aims to verify resiliency of applications whose replicas may be evicted on account on nodes turning unschedulable (Not Ready) due to lack of CPU resources.
- The CPU chaos is injected using a helper pod running the linux stress tool (a workload generator). The chaos is effected for a period equalling the TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
Application implies services. Can be reframed as: Tests application resiliency upon replica evictions caused due to lack of CPU resources

## Uses

??? info "View the uses of the experiment" 
    coming soon

## Prerequisites

??? info "Verify the prerequisites" 
    - Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.16 
    - Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing <code>kubectl get pods</code> in operator namespace (typically, <code>litmus</code>).If not, install from <a href="https://v1-docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus">here</a>
    - Ensure that the <code>node-cpu-hog</code> experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing <code>kubectl get chaosexperiments</code> in the desired namespace. If not, install from <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/generic/node-cpu-hog/experiment.yaml">here</a> 
    
## Default Validations

??? info "View the default validations" 
    The target nodes should be in ready state before and after chaos injection.

## Minimal RBAC configuration example (optional)

!!! tip "NOTE"   
    If you are using this experiment as part of a litmus workflow scheduled constructed & executed from chaos-center, then you may be making use of the [litmus-admin](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-admin-rbac.yaml) RBAC, which is pre installed in the cluster as part of the agent setup.

## Experiment Examples

### Common and Node specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common-tunables-for-all-experiments.md) and [Node specific tunable](common-tunables-for-node-experiments.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and node specific tunables.  

### Node CPU Cores

It contains number of cores of node CPU to be consumed. It can be tuned via `NODE_CPU_CORE` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/nodes/node-cpu-hog/node-cpu-core.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# stress the cpu of the targeted nodes
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: node-cpu-hog-sa
  experiments:
  - name: node-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # number of cpu cores to be stressed
        - name: NODE_CPU_CORE
          value: '2'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Node CPU Load

It contains percentage of node CPU to be consumed. It can be tuned via `CPU_LOAD` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/nodes/node-cpu-hog/node-cpu-load.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# stress the cpu of the targeted nodes by load percentage
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: node-cpu-hog-sa
  experiments:
  - name: node-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # percentage of cpu to be stressed
        - name: CPU_LOAD
          value: "100"
        # node cpu core should be provided as 0 for cpu load
        # to work otherwise it will take cpu core as priority
        - name: NODE_CPU_CORE
          value: '0'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
