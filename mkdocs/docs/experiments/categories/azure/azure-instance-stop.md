## Introduction

- It causes PowerOff an Azure instance before bringing it back to running state after the specified chaos duration.
- It helps to check the performance of the application/process running on the instance.

## Uses

??? info "View the uses of the experiment" 
    coming soon

## Prerequisites

??? info "Verify the prerequisites" 
    - Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.16 
    -  Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing <code>kubectl get pods</code> in operator namespace (typically, <code>litmus</code>).If not, install from <a href="https://v1-docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus">here</a>
    -  Ensure that the <code>azure-instance-stop</code> experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing <code>kubectl get chaosexperiments</code> in the desired namespace. If not, install from <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/azure/azure-instance-stop/experiment.yaml">here</a>
    - Ensure that you have sufficient Azure access to stop and start the an instance. 
    - We will use azure [ file-based authentication ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/go/azure-sdk-authorization#use-file-based-authentication) to connect with the instance using azure GO SDK in the experiment. For generating auth file run `az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth > azure.auth` Azure CLI command.
    - Ensure to create a Kubernetes secret having the auth file created in the step in `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. A sample secret file looks like:

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
          name: cloud-secret
        type: Opaque
        stringData:
          azure.auth: |-
            {
              "clientId": "XXXXXXXXX",
              "clientSecret": "XXXXXXXXX",
              "subscriptionId": "XXXXXXXXX",
              "tenantId": "XXXXXXXXX",
              "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
              "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
              "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "XXXXXXXXX",
              "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
              "galleryEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
              "managementEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX"
            }
        ```
    - If you change the secret key name (from `azure.auth`) please also update the `AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION` 
    ENV value on `experiment.yaml`with the same name.
    
## Default Validations

??? info "View the default validations" 
    - Azure instance should be in healthy state.

## Minimal RBAC configuration example (optional)

!!! tip "NOTE"   
    If you are using this experiment as part of a litmus workflow scheduled constructed & executed from chaos-center, then you may be making use of the [litmus-admin](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-admin-rbac.yaml) RBAC, which is pre installed in the cluster as part of the agent setup.

## Experiment Examples

### Common Experiment Tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common-tunables-for-all-experiments.md) to tune the common tunables for all the experiments.

### Stop Instances By Name

It contains comma separated list of instance names subjected to instance stop chaos. It can be tuned via `AZURE_INSTANCE_NAME` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/azure/azure-instance-stop/azure-instance.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## contains the azure instance details
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: azure-instance-stop-sa
  experiments:
  - name: azure-instance-stop
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # comma separated list of azure instance names
        - name: AZURE_INSTANCE_NAMES
          value: 'instance-01,instance-02'
        # name of the resource group
        - name: RESOURCE_GROUP
          value: '<resource group of AZURE_INSTANCE_NAME>'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Stop Scale Set Instances

It contains comma separated list of instance names subjected to instance stop chaos belonging to Scale Set or AKS. It can be tuned via `SCALE_SET` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/azure/azure-instance-stop/azure-scale-set-instance.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## contains the azure instance details for scale set instances or AKS nodes
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: azure-instance-stop-sa
  experiments:
  - name: azure-instance-stop
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # comma separated list of azure instance names
        - name: AZURE_INSTANCE_NAMES
          value: 'instance-01,instance-02'
        # name of the resource group
        - name: RESOURCE_GROUP
          value: '<resource group of Scale set>'
        # accepts enable/disable value. default is disable
        - name: SCALE_SET
          value: 'enable'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Multiple Iterations Of Chaos

The multiple iterations of chaos can be tuned via setting `CHAOS_INTERVAL` ENV. Which defines the delay between each iteration of chaos.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/azure/azure-instance-stop/chaos-interval.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# defines delay between each successive iteration of the chaos
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: azure-instance-stop-sa
  experiments:
  - name: azure-instance-stop
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # delay between each iteration of chaos
        - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
          value: '10'
         # time duration for the chaos execution
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
        - name: AZURE_INSTANCE_NAMES
          value: 'instance-01,instance-02'
        - name: RESOURCE_GROUP
          value: '<resource group of AZURE_INSTANCE_NAME>'
```
