## Introduction

- It injects http response latency on the service whose port is provided as `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` by starting proxy server and then redirecting the traffic through the proxy server.
- It can test the application's resilience to lossy/flaky http responses.

## Uses

??? info "View the uses of the experiment"
    coming soon

## Prerequisites

??? info "Verify the prerequisites"
    - Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.17
    - Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing <code>kubectl get pods</code> in operator namespace (typically, <code>litmus</code>).If not, install from <a href="https://v1-docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus">here</a>
    - Ensure that the <code>pod-http-latency</code> experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing <code>kubectl get chaosexperiments</code> in the desired namespace. If not, install from <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/generic/pod-http-latency/experiment.yaml">here</a>

## Default Validations

??? info "View the default validations"
    The application pods should be in running state before and after chaos injection.

## Minimal RBAC configuration example (optional)

!!! tip "NOTE"
    If you are using this experiment as part of a litmus workflow scheduled constructed & executed from chaos-center, then you may be making use of the [litmus-admin](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-admin-rbac.yaml) RBAC, which is pre installed in the cluster as part of the agent setup.

## Experiment Examples

### Common and Pod specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common-tunables-for-all-experiments.md) and [Pod specific tunable](common-tunables-for-pod-experiments.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and pod specific tunables.

### Target Service Port

It defines the port of the targeted service that is being targeted. It can be tuned via `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (pod-http-latency/target-service-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the port of the targeted service
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-http-latency-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```
### Proxy Port

It defines the port on which the proxy server will listen for requests. It can be tuned via `PROXY_PORT` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (pod-http-latency/proxy-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the port for proxy server
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1

  - name: pod-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port for proxy server
        - name: PROXY_PORT
          value: '8080'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Latency

It defines the latency value to be added to the http request. It can be tuned via `LATENCY` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (pod-http-latency/latency.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the latency value
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-http-latency-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the latency value
        - name: LATENCY
          value: '2000'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Toxicity
It defines the toxicity value to be added to the http request. It can be tuned via `TOXICITY` ENV.
Toxicity value defines the percentage of the total number of http requests to be affected.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (pod-http-latency/toxicity.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the toxicity
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-http-latency-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # toxicity is the probability of the request to be affected
        # provide the percentage value in the range of 0-100
        # 0 means no request will be affected and 100 means all request will be affected
        - name: TOXICITY
          value: "100"
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Network Interface
It defines the network interface to be used for the proxy. It can be tuned via `NETWORK_INTERFACE` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (pod-http-latency/network-interface.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the network interface for proxy
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-http-latency-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:

          value: "eth0"
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: '80'
```

### Container Runtime Socket Path

It defines the `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` and `SOCKET_PATH` ENV to set the container runtime and socket file path.

- `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`: It supports `docker`, `containerd`, and `crio` runtimes. The default value is `docker`.
- `SOCKET_PATH`: It contains path of docker socket file by default(`/var/run/docker.sock`). For other runtimes provide the appropriate path.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (pod-http-latency/container-runtime-and-socket-path.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the container runtime and socket file path
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"

          value: '/var/run/docker.sock'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```
