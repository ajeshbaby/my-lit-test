## Introduction

- The experiment aims to check the ability of nodes to accommodate the number of replicas a given application pod.

- This experiment can be used for other scenarios as well, such as for checking the Node auto-scaling feature. For example, check if the pods are successfully rescheduled within a specified period in cases where the existing nodes are already running at the specified limits.

## Uses

??? info "View the uses of the experiment" 
    coming soon

## Prerequisites

??? info "Verify the prerequisites" 
    - Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.16 
    - Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing <code>kubectl get pods</code> in operator namespace (typically, <code>litmus</code>).If not, install from <a href="https://v1-docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus">here</a>
    - Ensure that the <code>pod-autoscaler</code> experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing <code>kubectl get chaosexperiments</code> in the desired namespace. If not, install from <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/generic/pod-autoscaler/experiment.yaml">here</a> 
    
## Default Validations

??? info "View the default validations" 
    The application pods should be in running state before and after chaos injection.

## Minimal RBAC configuration example (optional)

!!! tip "NOTE"   
    If you are using this experiment as part of a litmus workflow scheduled constructed & executed from chaos-center, then you may be making use of the [litmus-admin](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-admin-rbac.yaml) RBAC, which is pre installed in the cluster as part of the agent setup.

## Experiment Examples

### Common and Pod specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common-tunables-for-all-experiments.md) and [Pod specific tunable](common-tunables-for-pod-experiments.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and pod specific tunables. 

### Replica counts

It defines the number of replicas, which should be present in the targeted application during the chaos. It can be tuned via `REPLICA_COUNT` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-autoscaler/replica-count.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the number of replicas 
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-autoscaler-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-autoscaler
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # number of replica, needs to scale
        - name: REPLICA_COUNT
          value: '3'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
