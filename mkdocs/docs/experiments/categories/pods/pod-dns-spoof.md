## Introduction

- Pod-dns-spoof injects chaos to spoof dns resolution in kubernetes pods.
- It causes dns resolution of target hostnames/domains to wrong IPs as specified by SPOOF_MAP in the engine config.

## Uses

??? info "View the uses of the experiment"
    coming soon

## Prerequisites

??? info "Verify the prerequisites"
    - Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.16
    -  Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing <code>kubectl get pods</code> in operator namespace (typically, <code>litmus</code>).If not, install from <a href="https://v1-docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus">here</a>
    -  Ensure that the <code>pod-dns-spoof</code> experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing <code>kubectl get chaosexperiments</code> in the desired namespace. If not, install from <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/generic/pod-dns-spoof/experiment.yaml">here</a>

## Default Validations

??? info "View the default validations"
    The application pods should be in running state before and after chaos injection.

## Minimal RBAC configuration example (optional)

!!! tip "NOTE"
    If you are using this experiment as part of a litmus workflow scheduled constructed & executed from chaos-center, then you may be making use of the [litmus-admin](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-admin-rbac.yaml) RBAC, which is pre installed in the cluster as part of the agent setup.

## Experiment Examples

### Common and Pod specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common-tunables-for-all-experiments.md) and [Pod specific tunable](common-tunables-for-pod-experiments.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and pod specific tunables.

### Spoof Map

It defines the map of the target hostnames eg. '{"abc.com":"spoofabc.com"}' where the key is the hostname that needs to be spoofed and value is the hostname where it will be spoofed/redirected to. It can be tuned via `SPOOF_MAP` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-dns-spoof/spoof-map.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# contains the spoof map for the dns spoofing
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-dns-spoof-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-dns-spoof
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # map of host names
        - name: SPOOF_MAP
          value: '{"abc.com":"spoofabc.com"}'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Container Runtime Socket Path

It defines the `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` and `SOCKET_PATH` ENV to set the container runtime and socket file path.

- `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`: It supports `docker` runtime only.
- `SOCKET_PATH`: It contains path of docker socket file by default(`/var/run/docker.sock`).

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-dns-spoof/container-runtime-and-socket-path.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the container runtime and socket file path
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-dns-spoof-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-dns-spoof
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # runtime for the container
        # supports docker
        - name: CONTAINER_RUNTIME
          value: 'docker'
        # path of the socket file
        - name: SOCKET_PATH
          value: '/var/run/docker.sock'
        # map of host names
        - name: SPOOF_MAP
          value: '{"abc.com":"spoofabc.com"}'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
