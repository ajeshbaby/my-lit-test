## Introduction

- It Causes (forced/graceful) pod failure of specific/random replicas of an application resources.
- It tests deployment sanity (replica availability & uninterrupted service) and recovery workflow of the application

## Uses

??? info "View the uses of the experiment" 
    In the distributed system like kubernetes it is very likely that your application replicas may not be sufficient to manage the traffic (indicated by SLIs) when some of the replicas are unavailable due to any failure (can be system or application) the application needs to meet the SLO(service level objectives) for this, we need to make sure that the applications have minimum number of available replicas. One of the common application failures is when the pressure on other replicas increases then to how the horizontal pod autoscaler scales based on observed resource utilization and also how much PV mount takes time upon rescheduling. The other important aspects to test are the MTTR for the application replica, re-elections of leader or follower like in kafka application the selection of broker leader,  validating minimum quorum to run the application for example in applications like percona, resync/redistribution of data.

    This experiment helps to reproduce such a scenario with forced/graceful pod failure on specific or random replicas of an application resource and checks the deployment sanity (replica availability & uninterrupted service) and recovery workflow of the application.

## Prerequisites


??? info "Verify the prerequisites" 
    - Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.16 
    -  Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing <code>kubectl get pods</code> in operator namespace (typically, <code>litmus</code>).If not, install from <a href="https://v1-docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus">here</a>
    -  Ensure that the <code>pod-delete</code> experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing <code>kubectl get chaosexperiments</code> in the desired namespace. If not, install from <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/generic/pod-delete/experiment.yaml">here</a> 

## Default Validations

??? info "View the default validations" 
    The application pods should be in running state before and after chaos injection.

## Minimal RBAC configuration example (optional)

!!! tip "NOTE"   
    If you are using this experiment as part of a litmus workflow scheduled constructed & executed from chaos-center, then you may be making use of the [litmus-admin](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-admin-rbac.yaml) RBAC, which is pre installed in the cluster as part of the agent setup.

## Experiment Examples

### Common and Pod specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common-tunables-for-all-experiments.md) and [Pod specific tunable](common-tunables-for-pod-experiments.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and pod specific tunables. 

### Force Delete

The targeted pod can be deleted `forcefully` or `gracefully`. It can be tuned with the `FORCE` env. It will delete the pod forcefully if `FORCE` is provided as `true` and it will delete the pod gracefully if `FORCE` is provided as `false`.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-delete/force.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# tune the deletion of target pods forcefully or gracefully
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-delete-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provided as true for the force deletion of pod
        # supports true and false value
        - name: FORCE
          value: 'true'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
        
       
```

### Multiple Iterations Of Chaos

The multiple iterations of chaos can be tuned via setting `CHAOS_INTERVAL` ENV. Which defines the delay between each iteration of chaos.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-delete/chaos-interval.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# defines delay between each successive iteration of the chaos
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-delete-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # delay between each iteration of chaos
        - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
          value: '15'
        # time duration for the chaos execution
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Random Interval

The randomness in the chaos interval can be enabled via setting `RANDOMNESS` ENV to `true`. It supports boolean values. The default value is `false`.
The chaos interval can be tuned via `CHAOS_INTERVAL` ENV. 

- If `CHAOS_INTERVAL` is set in the form of `l-r` i.e, `5-10` then it will select a random interval between l & r.
- If `CHAOS_INTERVAL` is set in the form of `value` i.e, `10` then it will select a random interval between 0 & value.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-delete/randomness-interval.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# contains random chaos interval with lower and upper bound of range i.e [l,r]
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-delete-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # randomness enables iterations at random time interval
        # it supports true and false value
        - name: RANDOMNESS
          value: 'true'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
        # it will select a random interval within this range
        # if only one value is provided then it will select a random interval within 0-CHAOS_INTERVAL range
        - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
          value: '5-10' 
```
