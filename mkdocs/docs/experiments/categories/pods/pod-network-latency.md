## Introduction

- It injects latency on the specified container by starting a traffic control (tc) process with netem rules to add egress delays
- It can test the application's resilience to lossy/flaky network

## Uses

??? info "View the uses of the experiment" 
    The experiment causes network degradation without the pod being marked unhealthy/unworthy of traffic by kube-proxy (unless you have a liveness probe of sorts that measures latency and restarts/crashes the container). The idea of this experiment is to simulate issues within your pod network OR microservice communication across services in different availability zones/regions etc. 

    Mitigation (in this case keep the timeout i.e., access latency low) could be via some middleware that can switch traffic based on some SLOs/perf parameters. If such an arrangement is not available the next best thing would be to verify if such a degradation is highlighted via notification/alerts etc,. so the admin/SRE has the opportunity to investigate and fix things. Another utility of the test would be to see what the extent of impact caused to the end-user OR the last point in the app stack on account of degradation in access to a downstream/dependent microservice. Whether it is acceptable OR breaks the system to an unacceptable degree. The experiment provides DESTINATION_IPS or DESTINATION_HOSTS so that you can control the chaos against specific services within or outside the cluster.

    The applications may stall or get corrupted while they wait endlessly for a packet. The experiment limits the impact (blast radius) to only the traffic you want to test by specifying IP addresses or application information.This experiment will help to improve the resilience of your services over time


## Prerequisites

??? info "Verify the prerequisites" 
    - Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.16 
    - Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing <code>kubectl get pods</code> in operator namespace (typically, <code>litmus</code>).If not, install from <a href="https://v1-docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus">here</a>
    - Ensure that the <code>pod-network-latency</code> experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing <code>kubectl get chaosexperiments</code> in the desired namespace. If not, install from <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/generic/pod-network-latency/experiment.yaml">here</a> 
    
## Default Validations

??? info "View the default validations" 
    The application pods should be in running state before and after chaos injection.

## Minimal RBAC configuration example (optional)

!!! tip "NOTE"   
    If you are using this experiment as part of a litmus workflow scheduled constructed & executed from chaos-center, then you may be making use of the [litmus-admin](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-admin-rbac.yaml) RBAC, which is pre installed in the cluster as part of the agent setup.

### Common and Pod specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common-tunables-for-all-experiments.md) and [Pod specific tunable](common-tunables-for-pod-experiments.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and pod specific tunables. 

### Network Latency

It defines the network latency(in ms) to be injected in the targeted application. It can be tuned via `NETWORK_LATENCY` ENV. 

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-network-latency/network-latency.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it inject the network-latency for the ingrees and egress traffic
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-network-latency-sa
  experiments:

      components:
        env:
        # network latency to be injected
        - name: NETWORK_LATENCY
          value: '2000' #in ms
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Destination IPs And Destination Hosts

The network experiments interrupt traffic for all the IPs/hosts by default. The interruption of specific IPs/Hosts can be tuned via `DESTINATION_IPS` and `DESTINATION_HOSTS` ENV.

- `DESTINATION_IPS`: It contains the IP addresses of the services or pods or the CIDR blocks(range of IPs), the accessibility to which is impacted.
- `DESTINATION_HOSTS`: It contains the DNS Names/FQDN names of the services, the accessibility to which, is impacted.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-network-latency/destination-ips-and-hosts.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it inject the chaos for the ingrees and egress traffic for specific ips/hosts
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"

    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-network-latency-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-network-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # supports comma separated destination ips
        - name: DESTINATION_IPS
          value: '8.8.8.8,192.168.5.6'
        # supports comma separated destination hosts
        - name: DESTINATION_HOSTS
          value: 'nginx.default.svc.cluster.local,google.com'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Network Interface

The defined name of the ethernet interface, which is considered for shaping traffic. It can be tuned via `NETWORK_INTERFACE` ENV. Its default value is `eth0`.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-network-latency/network-interface.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the network interface
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-network-latency-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-network-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # name of the network interface 
        - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
          value: 'eth0'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Jitter

It defines the jitter (in ms), a parameter that allows introducing a network delay variation. It can be tuned via `JITTER` ENV. Its default value is `0`.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-network-latency/network-latency-jitter.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the network latency jitter
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1

metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-network-latency-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-network-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # value of the network latency jitter (in ms) 
        - name: JITTER
          value: '200'
```

### Container Runtime Socket Path

It defines the `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` and `SOCKET_PATH` ENV to set the container runtime and socket file path.

- `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`: It supports `docker`, `containerd`, and `crio` runtimes. The default value is `docker`.
- `SOCKET_PATH`: It contains path of docker socket file by default(`/var/run/docker.sock`). For other runtimes provide the appropriate path.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-network-latency/container-runtime-and-socket-path.yaml yaml)
```yaml
