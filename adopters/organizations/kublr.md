### **Applications/Workloads or Infra that are being subjected to chaos by Litmus**

Kublr-provisioned Kubernetes clusters; we apply litmus chaos load to stress-test the clusters and identify the weak spots and components prone to failures under stress when customer applications stress the system

### **Why was Litmus chosen & how it is helping you (a brief description on the usecase)**

Litmus is well-documented, well-supported open source tool with a great community and development team. It is flexible and allows us to adjust the chaos tests any way we need.

### **Are you using it as part of devtest, CI/CD, in staging/pre-prod/prod or other**

This is currently used as a part of development testing and adhoc experiments, although we are working on including litmus chaos tests into our standard automated QA process
