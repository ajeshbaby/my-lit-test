### **Why we explored litmus**

With around 5.6 millions end-users, and applications that generate hudge traffic and datas,
the resiliency of our apps and infrastructures is a must-have!  

- Litmus is OPEN SOURCE
- Litmus is designed for Kubernetes
- Litmus is easy to deploy ( helm chart )
- Litmus is extendable ( experiments libs, predefined workflows, private hubs )


### How we explored litmus

We explored Litmus to validate and increase the resiliency of our private and public Kubernetes clouds.

- Testing resiliency of Kubernetes Infrastructure Components
- Testing resiliency of Public applications hosted on Kubernetes
- Testing resiliency of Private applications hosted on Kubernetes


### Benefits of litmus

Litmus allowed us to identify and work on the observability, configuration, and high availability of certain components which were not resilient.

With the history of experiences, the Reliability score system, and all the statistics on the chaos tests, using random recurring tests, litmus allows us to audit, over time, the resilience of our platforms, and to have a global vision of the state of it.
