## How do we use Litmus
We have used Litmus to build out Chaos Engineering platforms with some of our large E-Commerce customers to improve resilience for big sales periods such as Black Friday.

We looked into quite a few tools, and Litmus provided us with the flexibility we needed, whilst bootstrapping many of the components we would have to write ourselves.

We also used Litmus Chaos experiments when discussing some of our customer's architecture constraints, and showing them real world cases of how to make Kubernetes more resilient.

One concrete use case was our customer wanting to build a cluster per app, whilst we wanted to build bigger clusters for easier management. We would use Litmus to show what application failure looks like on one part of the cluster, and show global resilience in their cluster when this happens.
The Litmus community and *product have been a great addition to our tool stack, and provided many benefits for us.
