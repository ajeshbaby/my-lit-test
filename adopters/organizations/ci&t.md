## Why Do We Use Litmus: 

After an evaluation period of some Chaos Engineering tools, we chose Litmus because it is a more mature tool that would meet most of our needs. We are in the implementation, configuration, and process definition phase.
AB-Inbev's BEES is a huge project that has hundreds of microservices, it has been a great challenge to adapt Litmus in this process, making customizations and counting on the help of the Litmus community to evolve the tool and thus achieve our goal of making it available to the teams.
Some points that made us choose Litmus:

- Based on K8S resources
- SSO
- Customization of attacks, attacks in parallel
- Installation on multiple clusters
- GitOps
