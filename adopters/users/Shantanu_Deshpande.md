I was looking for a cloud-native way of introducing chaos and after going through the details 
and other options, Litmus was the best fit. Usage of Litmus is still in preliminary stages. 
A limited set of chaos experiments are being used for testing resiliency. This will change in the 
future, with more experiments planned to be adopted.
