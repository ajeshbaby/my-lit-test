I started using LitmusChaos for a student project in November 2019 and have been observing its extraordinary evolution since then. My company does not yet have plans for adopting chaos engineering because the system we develop is in its early stages. So they kind of commissioned me to find a possible solution and implementation and above all gain knowledge. I came across LitmusChaos through the CNCF Landscape in my research for available open source tools. I did a quick assessment of other tools and found LitmusChaos to fulfill my requirements completely. The help I received from the MayaData developers during my early stages of "is it me or is there really a bug?" convinced me to invest more time in the community and even start constructing own chaoslibs. The presentation I recently held to my team (and many people in the video call I didn't know :D) earned me lots of positive feedback and a possible research question for my upcoming bachelor thesis. So let's see what the future has to offer!
