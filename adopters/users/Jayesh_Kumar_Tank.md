I started exploring the facinating world of Chaos Engineering while working on stitching together CloudNative Validation Suite. In persuit of finding the suitable candidate, I evaluated
couple of Chaos Engineering tool chains, both free as well commercial and finally settled on to LitmusChaos. I have my own  reasons to do so, which includes super helpful developers and community supporting this project.
While evaluating LitmusChaos for my pipeline - I requested a new feature for Aborting the active experiment,  which was accepted and is being actively worked on.
Another thing which sets LitmusChaos apart from many other players is it being fully CloudNative, ease of development in Ansible. ChaosHub is a central place for community to contribute their work and make it available for others.
In the past I have been contributing to Litmus-Docs project as maintainer and looking forward to contribute a couple of Chaos Experiments. Keeping my fingers crossed!!
